### Core Value Props

| Owner's Question | FlowForge Answer |
|------------------|------------------|
| "Mera business kaisa chal raha hai?" | Health Score: 74/100 — Good |
| "Next week paisa bachega?" | 7-day projection with alerts |
| "Staff ko kab dena hai?" | Salary calendar + reminders |
| "Main profit mein hoon ya loss mein?" | Live P&L this month |
| "Kahan dhyan dena chahiye?" | Top 3 things to watch |

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### The User: Priya, Tiffin Service Owner

| Fact | Reality |
|------|---------|
| Monthly Revenue | ₹1,10,000 |
| Monthly Expenses | ₹75,000 |
| Staff | 3 people (₹23,000/month) |
| Record Keeping | Physical notebook |
| Financial Visibility | Zero |

### What Priya Can't Answer Today

1. **"Is my business profitable?"** — She sees revenue but not expenses clearly
2. **"Will I have cash on salary day?"** — Always a surprise
3. **"Am I growing or shrinking?"** — No comparison to past
4. **"What should I worry about?"** — Everything feels urgent
5. **"How much do customers owe?"** — Lost in notebook pages

### Why This Matters

- 63M MSMEs in India
- 95% have **zero financial visibility**
- Cash crunches are the #1 business killer
- Existing tools (Khatabook, Tally) show data but don't **predict or advise**

### 4.2 📊 PRESENT: Business Health Dashboard

#### The Health Score (0-100)

Simple, single number that tells you: **"Is my business okay?"**

```
💚 HEALTH SCORE: 78/100
   "Your business is healthy"

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Cash Runway      ████████░░  82    │
│ Profit Margin    ███████░░░  71    │
│ Collection Speed ████████░░  80    │
│ Expense Control  ███████░░░  74    │
│ Growth Trend     ████████░░  83    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

vs Last Month: ↑ 5 points
```

#### Health Score Components

| Component | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Cash Runway** | 25% | Days of expenses covered by current cash |

### 4.4 👥 PAYROLL: Staff Management

#### Setup (One Time)

```
Owner: "3 staff hain"

Agent: "Naam aur salary batao:
        Example: Ramu 10000 monthly 1st"

Owner: "Ramu 10000 1st
        Sita 8000 1st
        Bunty 500 daily"

Agent: 
✅ Staff saved:

👤 Ramu - ₹10,000/month (Due: 1st)
👤 Sita - ₹8,000/month (Due: 1st)
👤 Bunty - ₹500/day

Total monthly: ₹23,000 + Bunty daily
Next salary: Dec 1 (4 days)
```

#### Ongoing Tracking

**Advance Given:**
```
Owner: "Ramu ko 2000 advance diya"

Agent:
✅ Advance logged

Ramu:
• Advance: ₹2,000
• Next salary: ₹10,000 - ₹2,000 = ₹8,000
• Due: Dec 1
```

**Salary Paid:**
```
Owner: "Sita ki salary de di"

Agent:
✅ Salary paid

Sita - December: ₹8,000 ✓

Remaining this month:
• Ramu: ₹8,000 (after advance)
• Bunty: ₹3,500 pending
```

#### Salary Reminders (Proactive)

3 days before salary day:
```
📅 *SALARY REMINDER*

Due in 3 days (Dec 1):
• Ramu: ₹8,000 (after ₹2K advance)
• Sita: ₹8,000
• Total: ₹16,000

Your projected cash on Dec 1: ₹19,000
Status: ✅ Covered

(Bunty daily: ₹1,500 pending this week)
```

If short:
```
📅 *SALARY ALERT* ⚠️

Due in 3 days (Dec 1):
• Total due: ₹16,000
• Projected cash: ₹12,000
• Shortfall: ₹4,000

💡 To cover this:
• Pending from customers: ₹17,000
• Need to collect: ₹4,000+ by Thursday
```

---

### 4.5 👁️ KEY METRICS: What to Watch

#### The "Watch List" (In Every Brief)

Instead of drowning in data, FlowForge shows **3 things to watch**:

```
👁️ *WATCH THIS WEEK*

1. 🔴 Cash on Friday
   Salary day, you'll be ₹4K short
   → Collect from TechPark or Kumar

2. 🟡 TechPark payment
   ₹12,000 pending, 15 days old
   → Usually pays by day 20

3. 🟢 Profit looking good
   34% margin this month
   → 3% better than October
```

#### Metric Categories

| Category | Metrics Tracked |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Cash** | Current balance, runway days, upcoming crunch |
| **Revenue** | This week, this month, vs last period |
| **Expenses** | By category, vs budget, unusual spikes |
| **Profit** | Margin %, absolute amount, trend |
| **Receivables** | Total pending, aging, problem accounts |
| **Payroll** | Upcoming dates, amounts, coverage |

---

### 4.6 💬 SIMPLE REMINDERS (Not Complex)

**Philosophy:** Reminders are a small utility, not the main product.

#### How It Works

Owner asks → Agent sends → Done.

```
Owner: "TechPark ko remind kar do"

Agent:
✅ Reminder sent to TechPark

"Hi, friendly reminder that ₹12,000 is pending 
for tiffin service. UPI: priya@upi"

I'll let you know when they respond.
```

**That's it.** No escalation ladders, no automation levels, no complex flows.

#### Optional: Auto-Reminders

If owner enables:
- Agent sends ONE polite reminder after 7 days
- Owner is notified
- No further automation

```
Settings: Auto-reminder after 7 days? [Yes/No]
```

## 10. Demo Script (4 Minutes)

### Opening (30 sec)

> "Meet Priya. Tiffin service, ₹1 lakh revenue. But she never knows if she'll have cash for salaries. She doesn't know if she's profitable. She can't see her future. Until now."

### The Morning Brief (45 sec)

> "Every morning, Priya gets this..."

*Show morning brief*

> "Cash position. Health score. And most importantly — what the next week looks like. See that red flag on Friday? That's salary day. She's going to be short. The agent saw it coming."

### The Projection (60 sec)

> "Let's zoom in..."

*Ask: "Next week kaisa hai"*

> "Day by day. When she'll have money. When she won't. Friday is the problem — ₹3K short for salaries. But the agent doesn't just warn her — it tells her how to fix it: TechPark owes ₹12K. One collection solves it."

### Logging + Payroll (45 sec)

> "She logs expenses naturally..."

*Type: "Sabzi 2000, Ramu salary done"*

> "Everything tracked. The agent knows Ramu is paid, Sita still pending. No spreadsheets, no apps. Just chat."

### The Health Score (30 sec)

> "And every week, a single number..."

*Show health score*

> "72 out of 100. Good, but watch cash flow. Better than last month. She never knew her business was healthy. Now she does."

### Close (30 sec)

> "This isn't expense tracking. It's not a ledger. It's the answer to the question every business owner has: What does tomorrow look like?"

> "63 million MSMEs. Zero visibility into their future. We're changing that — one WhatsApp message at a time."
